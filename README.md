## About RiotLogin
RiotLogin is automatic login tool for Riot Client.

This program uses SendKeys and keybd_event. Not any Riot API or anything illegal. Does what you do but faster and can save accounts.

## What Riot Support think about RiotLogin?

Riot Support staff told me that they can't say for sure whether this app will get you banned or not.
"When Vanguard is turned on, using kind of programs like RiotLogin and doing stuff with it can get you banned, even it is very unlikely. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that you will not be banned."

So if you're using RiotLogin for LoL, TFT or LoR and Vanguard isn't turned on then you're okay with it. **But if you use RiotLogin for VALORANT or Vanguard is turned on** (although I don't think you will be banned), **use it on your own risk**. (I'm using RiotLogin myself. And that's why i coded it for.)

## Usage
Add your account on settings screen and select account to log in. Then click Login. That's it!
