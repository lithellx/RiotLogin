There is no internal process. Its fully external.

## What Riot think about RiotLogin?

Riot Support staff told me that they can't say for sure whether this app will get you banned or not.
"When Vanguard is turned on, using kind of programs like RiotLogin and doing stuff with it can get you banned, even it is very unlikely. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that you will not be banned."

So if you're using RiotLogin for LoL, TFT or LoR and Vanguard isn't turned on then you're okay with it. **But if you use RiotLogin for VALORANT or Vanguard is turned on** (although I don't think you will be banned), **use it on your own risk**.

## Usage
Add your account on settings screen and select account to log in. Then click Login. That's it!
